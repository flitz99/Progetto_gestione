Autore recensione: Michael Bregman
Testo recensione: SLC Punk is a great example of what happens when the ideals of youth wear thin, and when one is forced to make a choice that entails giving up a lifestyle, that while is a definite road to nowhere, is very near and dear to the heart, and chooseing a secure future, but said future is the very embodiment of all that you held dear stood against. Especially when you know that the secure future is the right chioce.

Autore recensione: deckocards
Testo recensione: I thorougly enjoyed the Book of Matthew not only because it followed the NIV transalation word for word but the portrayal of Jesus was superb!  I've never seen a more human example of Jesus Christ.  He was playful, full of joy, and compassionate.  This is a MUST SEE!  The Falling Fire movie was also good but more of a dramatic portrayal than a word for word account.

Autore recensione: Curtis Hickman
Testo recensione: Way back in English Lit, University of Oregon, 25 years ago, I remember one idea that that once something achieves perfection in anything, it self distructs, always.  A near perfect chair exists, a near perfect painting, a near perfect poem, a near pefect fly fisherman. But none of these exist in a perfect form.  There is only one perfection and to attempt to mimimic it assures distruction. This movie portrays that notion, just fine.

Testo recensione: If your goal is DTS Music on a medium to high end system,  you'll be disappointed with this recording.  To me, a decent 5.1 mix is a deep full sound with a sound stage that puts you on site.  This DTS recording is  tinny and flat.  I really like Sheryl Crow, but this recording mix is best  left for low end stereo.  After listening to two tracks, I turned it off  and moved on to something more exciting.  5.1 recordings are just starting  to take off, this isn't the model to follow.

They sing verses directly out of the bible. I find myself singing the verses throughout the day. It is a great tool to put a song in your heart that is in fact God's word.

The replacement dvd was very good.  Sound was even and consistent.  However, I do not understand that why the second dvd is different from the first.  The begining of the the first is different from the second.  Either way, the second dvd is good and I will enjoy watching it durning the holidays.  Victor Morales

Testo recensione: I disagree with the viewer from Cambrige Ontario. I found this version lovely! Samantha Morton was excellent (I need to see "Emma" now), reserved, thoughtful, just as Jane was in the book. Jane had high emotions  but did not strike out often...the childhood was a small part of the book,  and though important, it is not the major part of the story. The  relationship with Bessie and Helen and Mrs Reed are important as well. I  found this version to be just fine, and I am going to buy it!

Testo recensione: I just saw this a couple days ago for the first time.  I had no real clue about the movie, just that it was something about aliens.  I have to admit, I really fell in love with it.  It's nowhere near as dazzling as the special effects produced today, but it is still quite good.  The visuals are still amazing, despite how old the technology for it is.  If you like sci-fi stuff, and haven't seen this, do so.  Maybe it's not as good as star wars, but it's still good.

Testo recensione: After "Mac cartney", Paul wanted to prove he wasn't only an ex-beatle. John lennon was very severe with him in his song "How do you sleep". So, it is the answer. A huge success, with several great  songs, like "Uncle Albert Admiral Alsey" (whixh reached the first  place at the charts) or "Dear boy" which sound like "Martha  My dear", he wrote three years before fot the white album from The  Beatles. Maybe his best recording with "Band on the run".

Testo recensione: There is a great idea here. A good solid story. But... this is a great example of poor execution. The Children is, for lack of a better word, boring. Nothing happens. You could come 30 minutes late to this movie and not miss a thing. I think with a better cast and much better director and a good screenwriter to punch up the action and scares, this could be a really good movie. But right now, it just makes me sterile.

Testo recensione: I actually love this movie and think it is well acted.  However, like another reviewer, I thought there were a couple of scenes about Potiphar's wife's attempts at seduction that were completely gratuitous and stretch what scripture says, hence only 4 stars.  The Bible isn't broken, don't try to fix it.  Every other part is quite wonderful.  I just fast-forward through the unnecessary parts.  Joseph is my favorite character in the Bible, after Jesus of course.

You would think that this would be boring but it is not since good heavy metal is just as good as any other rock music and they are very accomplished vocalists, descent lyricists and great muisicians. The book-let is well done and the font used is easy on the eye which is nice. This is an album not to be missed by BS fans or fans of great music for that manner.

No words can do it justice.  It must be seen. Also, there was quite a lot in the book about the intricate art and skill of fly fishing. The movie emphasized relationships and family dynamics which I found more interesting. The movie was beautifully done. I will probably watch it again sometime just for the scenery.

The frequent applause is 20-30 decibels too loud and interrupts what would be one of my favorite recordings far to often. The hot crispy frying egg applause every two minutes really gets me reaching for the volume control. The cd is worth having, but it could have been great!

Testo recensione: This is an accurate and realistic depiction of Scripture. It is nice to watch a Bible story that is not a cartoon and not an overacted, way too serious presentation. Bible heroes on film are often treated as if they walked on earth with a halo constantly hovering over them. This is a story about a man who follows God's heart through thick and thin (mostly thin), but you can relate to him because he is portrayed as an ordinary, albeit tremendously faithful, man.

It would have been  interesting to have some "behind the scenes" footage and interviews to give it a little more visual interest. Oddly, EC has never been the most compelling artist to watch. He's just a little too passive on stage, although I appreciate the fact that he's more reserved and dignified than other guitarists. But sometimes he just looks like he's about to fall asleep.

Autore recensione: Robert Hedstrom
Testo recensione: Another fannytastic drama with the very great actor, Harrison Ford. There is one flaw right up front; the terrorists who came on board with the President would have never passed security; in fact, what happens at the beginning would never happen in reality. All these unknown men about nine of em just get onboard Air Force One, and it is not clear why security failed to apprehend any of them. This is glossed over fast. I think it's another great H. Ford movie nonetheless.

Testo recensione: IN RESPONSE OF A REVIEW THAT I JUST READ ABOUT THIS DVD, THE DOLBY DIGITAL TRACK IS 5.0, NOT 5.1. THIS MAKES YOU PRACTICALLY "BASSLESS" IF YOU HAVE A HOME THEATER WITH 5 SPEAKERS AND A SUBWOOFER, THIS LAST ONE WILL NOT SOUND AT ALL. HOWEVER YOU CAN FIX THIS LITTLE PROBLEM BY LISTENING TO THE 2.0 (STEREO) SOUND AND USE YOUR DOLBY PRO LOGIC DECODER ON THE HOME THEATER RECEIVER OR AMP, YOU'LL HAVE BEST SURROUND SOUND THIS WAY AND YOUR SUBWOOFER WILL DO HIS JOB VERY WELL.

Even though he is using some  hip-hop on his new album, you can also hear his great guitar skills.

This is warrior spirit and personal honor, which can also be seen in "The thirteenth Warrior," another much misunderstood film.

I have seen them 3 times live and have never been disappointed with the quality of sound in person.  This item should be removed from the shelves for poor quality in sound

Testo recensione: THE PICTURE AND SOUND QUALITY IS GOOD. THE MOVIE ITSELF IS PRETTY GOOD CONSIDERING, THOUGH IT'S NO EXORCIST. I AM UPSET ABOUT THE FORMAT. THE ONLY REASON I GOT THIS IS BECAUSE IT STATED IT WAS IN FULL SCREEN AND WIDE SCREEN FORMAT. IT ENDED UP BEING ONLY WIDE SCREEN FORMAT. I WANTED A FULL SCREEN FORMAT. I DON'T LIKE WIDE SCREEN FORMAT. OTHER THAN THE QUALITY OF THE MOVIE AND THE MOVIE ITSELF, I'M UNHAPPY WITH THE TRANSACTION.

Autore recensione: Beautifully Human
Testo recensione: Babs and Nick Nolte are great in this movie! I ran across "The Prince of Tides" on television one day and knew immediately that I had to get this movie. I even read the book that its based on by Pat Conroy. A family, haunted by the ghosts of a painful secret, is in danger of losing everything. Their road to redemption lies in the telling of events hidden long ago. To get the full effect of this movie, read the book! Great experience, a movie you won't regret buying!

Autore recensione: NM Red
Testo recensione: After just reading the book the movie was quite a disappointment.  Of course a movie cannot have the detail of the book, but a lot of the highlights I thought were overlooked.  It lacked telling the love the people had for their land and the sacrifice for it.  The movie was mostly just a love story, and there are so many of those that are just monotony rehashed.

Categoria: Movies and TV, Nome del prodotto : Jesus The Christ: The movie version of The Visual Bible's Matthew 
Autore recensione: Rev. John Stanton
Testo recensione: This approach to Matthews's Gospel was superbly done.  The original text is used unexpurgated, but with the entire story acted out in full colour.  Anyone thinking of starting to take an interest in the Bible would be very well advised to buy this DVD.  And if you are sufficiently enthralled, there is a similar one based on the book of Acts.

Testo recensione: This is a very low budget movie.  I wanted my teen to see it failed to keep her attention because it was so fake and in her words, "low budget".  It was a bit pricey as well.  The message was good, just think for the price of this movie, it could have had more realistic effects.

Testo recensione: We actually returned one of these DVDs for a replacement.  The second was no better than the first.  The volume quality was so poor that we had to keep the volume control on high to just barely hear the sound.  Video quality was also poor.

Autore recensione: Amazon Customer
Testo recensione: By now you probably know the story of Resident Evil.  So, I'll just get right to the review.  It was a decent horror/action thriller with some fun.  No, it is not a great flick in acting but who cares.  You just come to see zombies getting blown up and buckets of blood.  Although the gore is not all that much for a horror film, it's about right for this.  Just don't think too much at this movie and you might enjoy it.

Autore recensione: M. Rife
Testo recensione: I have listened to most ofMaccas records with the exception of Ram. I purchased the remastered release and I must say half way through the disc I was hooked. The music is both loud and mellow and at times I can hear the unmistakable influence of the Beach Boys, well it is no secret that both Paul and Brian Wilson had a mutual respect for one another.  This is a fine recording and for the McCartney fan do yourself an enormous Faber and get yourself a copy!

Testo recensione: For as much hype as there was about this movie, it was not as good as I expected. Actors did a fair job with acting. I don't know how old the movie is, but effects in it weren't good either. Good plot, it was just not done very good. Sorry I spent the money, but thats the only way to find out.

Testo recensione: I don't know what to make of this. I know this has a lot of the Street Survivors line-up but the songs and production leave me feeling like I just listened to a Nickelback record. The attitude and laid back bluesy swagger have been replaced by a modern rock (with a tinge of metal) sound. While I was listening to this it just didn't feel like I was listening to a Lynyrd Skynyrd record.
