Autore recensione: Michael Bregman
Testo recensione: SLC Punk is a great example of what happens when the ideals of youth wear thin, and when one is forced to make a choice that entails giving up a lifestyle, that while is a definite road to nowhere, is very near and dear to the heart, and chooseing a secure future, but said future is the very embodiment of all that you held dear stood against. Especially when you know that the secure future is the right chioce.

Autore recensione: Just Mike
Testo recensione: I just didn't 'get' this. Was there any back story that I missed? Its about kids who come down with this ?virus? and start killing the adults in various gruesome ways. There didn't seem to be any point. Whoever made this movie simply wanted to showcase the art of gruesome deaths on screen? A good horror movie needs a good story to back up the special effects. And the occasional moody shot of gaunt trees in winter doesn't cut it either. Just not a good horror movie.

Autore recensione: Curtis Hickman
Testo recensione: Way back in English Lit, University of Oregon, 25 years ago, I remember one idea that that once something achieves perfection in anything, it self distructs, always.  A near perfect chair exists, a near perfect painting, a near perfect poem, a near pefect fly fisherman. But none of these exist in a perfect form.  There is only one perfection and to attempt to mimimic it assures distruction. This movie portrays that notion, just fine.

Testo recensione: This CD comes with copy protection software, which, when installed, wrecks havoc on your computer and instantly compromises your online security and safety.  Ugly, malicious forms of spyware are loaded, and your PC will soon be hijacked.  Is this any way to treat customers?  I love VR, but Sony/BMG must do away with copy protection and respect our RIGHT to make legitimate copies as we so desire.  After all, the number of music fans with iPods is growing.

Comatose and Whispers in the Dark are so good. Sounds so good in my rockin' sound system! Since I bought this I would love to see them live and they are coming to a town near you this summer!

Just popping this tape into the VCR and seeing the opening scene of Stevie's plane flying over Red Rocks and the effect of her voice echoing through the  mountains is enough to give me goosebumps.  This is one of my favorite  videos ever.  The visual effects/settings are out of this world. A definite  must have for anyone who has ever said "Wow!" over Stevie.

Autore recensione: M.J.J. Nuchelmans
Testo recensione: Bought this DVD Yesterday. I play it in Dolby Stereo, Sound is not that well mixed. That said it is very entertaining and you can solve this sound problem if you juggle the bass and treble dials a bit. If compared to "The Eagles - Hell Freezes Over", this is noway near as well balanced, but it really captures the "Sheryl Crow Live" experience. There are much better mixed DVD's, but this is far from a bad buy. Buy it, you will not regret it.

Testo recensione: The first dvd was corrupted.  The sound was distored, as well as not even.  It would get loud, then drop in volume, then get loud again and did not sound right at all.  The replacement dvd was very good.  Sound was even and consistent.  However, I do not understand that why the second dvd is different from the first.  The begining of the the first is different from the second.  Either way, the second dvd is good and I will enjoy watching it durning the holidays.  Victor Morales

Testo recensione: IN RESPONSE OF A REVIEW THAT I JUST READ ABOUT THIS DVD, THE DOLBY DIGITAL TRACK IS 5.0, NOT 5.1. THIS MAKES YOU PRACTICALLY "BASSLESS" IF YOU HAVE A HOME THEATER WITH 5 SPEAKERS AND A SUBWOOFER, THIS LAST ONE WILL NOT SOUND AT ALL. HOWEVER YOU CAN FIX THIS LITTLE PROBLEM BY LISTENING TO THE 2.0 (STEREO) SOUND AND USE YOUR DOLBY PRO LOGIC DECODER ON THE HOME THEATER RECEIVER OR AMP, YOU'LL HAVE BEST SURROUND SOUND THIS WAY AND YOUR SUBWOOFER WILL DO HIS JOB VERY WELL.

Testo recensione: I just saw this a couple days ago for the first time.  I had no real clue about the movie, just that it was something about aliens.  I have to admit, I really fell in love with it.  It's nowhere near as dazzling as the special effects produced today, but it is still quite good.  The visuals are still amazing, despite how old the technology for it is.  If you like sci-fi stuff, and haven't seen this, do so.  Maybe it's not as good as star wars, but it's still good.

I am a die hard prog fan and ccm collector as well. This lp is musically balanced and the players show top notch ability and skill in each track. Her voice is as pretty as her face and she can vary her style from soft to intense. Worshipful as well as upbeat.

Autore recensione: Robert Hedstrom
Testo recensione: Another fannytastic drama with the very great actor, Harrison Ford. There is one flaw right up front; the terrorists who came on board with the President would have never passed security; in fact, what happens at the beginning would never happen in reality. All these unknown men about nine of em just get onboard Air Force One, and it is not clear why security failed to apprehend any of them. This is glossed over fast. I think it's another great H. Ford movie nonetheless.

Testo recensione: I wanted to like this CD. But let's face it, after the first 2 songs it all just starts to sound cloned. Is this what a good album is supposed to sound like? I remember when every Skillet track had a unique sound, but alas, those days are gone.  If you like music that all sounds the same as the last track, this is a great CD for you. Otherwise purchase the first, second, and last track by themselves. They are really the only tracks that matter.

Testo recensione: I order & watched this movie last year, and as far as Christian films go, I personally have seen MUCH better-I can't explain it too well, except that the acting was just OK, and the film type they used felt home-movieish & amateurish.  The messages they were conveying were right on the money, tho. The special effects were good, tho, and the idea about the sign on top of the hospital was really clever.  Would I buy it again?  Hmm, probably not. It didn't give me chills once.

Long may you run sounds really  good on pump organ maybe even better than the original on the Long may you  run lp. It is also good hearing the tracks from Silver& gold just done  solo. I recomend this video to any Neil Young fan

This is a great package - really nice heavy duty slipbook packaging with some great art cards as well which are asking to be framed.  Too many great bits for me to mention but one of my favourites is Scorsese himself as one of De Niro's passengers - unforgettable!  To UK/Euro buyers - this one works fine on UK/Euro blu-ray players and I think this package beats the UK edition - and is just as cheap.  Total bargain!

It's a new sound that a lot of people like.  Santana was great before, and he's just as good now.  A good artist needs  to do some changing sometimes... he did.  Even though he is using some  hip-hop on his new album, you can also hear his great guitar skills.
