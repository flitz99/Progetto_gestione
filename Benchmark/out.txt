	 DCG = 3 					25273 	 This movie is Streisand's best, and ditto for Nick Nolte. It's the story of Tom Wingo. It is the story of passion and love and hate and fear and redemption. Based on Pat Conroy's brilliant novel it is mesmerizing and touches the heart in a way that no other movie has quite managed to do.
	 DCG = 1 					17699 	 Watched Upstairs Downstairs in the 70s and enjoyed it.  Enjoying it even more this time around.  A real precurser to Downton Abbey which really borrowed heavily from U/D.
	 DCG = 1 					23172 	 Love the music and story.
	 DCG = 1 					22702 	 Anybody that has a copy that can be burned on DVD I would be interested in buying as well..the full version of course...let me know ...email me at dudaluvs@hotmail.com
	 DCG = 1 					27781 	 Very easy to play and watch.  Love this movie and so nice to know I couldn't go to Netflix, my local movie store or anywhere else, but found it on Amazon.  Thank you!
	 DCG = 1 					21380 	 this is one of my top five favorite movies of all time.  The visual effects were groundbreaking for their day and still hold up well over 30 years later.  I particularly enjoyed Richard Dreyfus's acting as he accurately conveys the peculiar sense of urgency that motivates his character.
	 DCG = 1 					22206 	 Always enjoy Julia.  It was a movie that I had seen a long time ago.  Still nice to see it.
	 DCG = 2 					17403 	 I enjoyed this movie very much.  After just finishing the novel I bought  this movie.  I was really happy to see how close they stayed to the actual  book.  Most other movies take advantage of it.  This is a must! The camera  work done in the film is also really great.  I especially loved the way  that they ended it.  Ioan is fabulous and Charlotte shines as  Miss. Havisham.  Orlick was amazing!!  In fact everything about this movie  was! A VERY VERY MUST!!!
	 DCG = 1 					15959 	 I had seen the advertisement and wanted to purchase it through amazon.com and received the item on time and my daughter enjoyed it very much, It was a surprise gift for her :).
2	 'quarries: '	DVD OR VHS			7				risultati
	 DCG = 1 					18207 	 If you've seen the 1983 version on VHS with Timothy Dalton as Rochester (or read the book), you will be very disappointed with this version.  Several crucial parts of the story are left out completely, such as Jane learning that she has been left a sizeable inheritance. Also, Rochester is overacted, and the growth of the relationship between he and Jane is unconvincing.  I bought this because it was on DVD, and wish I hadn't.  I'll wait for the 1983 version to be put on DVD.
	 DCG = 1 					16726 	 It seemed great until I found out that the physical DVD media was of very poor quality and there are parts that freeze and skip no matter what I try.  This only happens with some portions of the DVD, and I only discovered the problem after the refund policy expired, so Amazon refuses to refund my money. A bad experience all around.
	 DCG = 2 					19209 	 This was one of my favorite films and I was happy to be able to add it to my DVD collection. It was a great price and a lot easier to do on line than look for it in any retail store.
	 DCG = 1 					16916 	 We  were fortunate enough to  attend Wendy's seminar in Fort Lauderdale.  Wendy is a dynamic trainer and coach.  The DVD reflects her  knowledge and powerful presentation skills.  An absolute must have for the Internet Marketer.
	 DCG = 1 					22702 	 Anybody that has a copy that can be burned on DVD I would be interested in buying as well..the full version of course...let me know ...email me at dudaluvs@hotmail.com
	 DCG = 3 					19702 	 DVD arrived in great condition n plays fine.
	 DCG = 3  					24668 	 The DVD works perfectly, so consider this a review of the film. An enjoyable watch, but could be better.
3	 'quarries: '	bad AND packing			7				risultati
	 DCG = 1 					22810 	 This was a lot more entertaining than the original, but it did not need to show the girls running around with their tops wide open.  It took the edge off the suspense and trepidation.  Freddy Prinze jr did not have a big  enough part to play, and the main thing missing was Barry.
	 DCG = 1 					18120 	 I saw this ages ago and it is still by far the most perfectly cast retelling of Jane Eyre I've ever seen. Mr. Rochester is not supposed to be a young, handsome gentleman (sorry Fassbender). Ciaran Hinds is none of those things but still is wildly attractive as his character. Samantha Morton is pitch perfect as well. I've been wanting to see this again for a long time. I'm so glad I finally made the purchase.
	 DCG = 1 					16891 	 Internet Marketing can be intimidating especially for people new to the industry.  Wendy takes the anxiety away with a simple, step-by-step approach to a very innovative system using the power of Google advertising.  Very powerful information - thank you so much!

	 DCG = 1 					19370 	 I have shopped online enough to become, sometimes, overcome by the frustration involved with someone selling me bad product. After all this I cant tell you how much I appreciate someone that delivers quality for a good price...it saves me all the pain and headache as well.

	 DCG = 1 					31128 	 My kid is 22 months and can't stop watching this video she loves it.  I've read many bad reviews about kids getting upset when Elmo loses his blanket.  What a bunch of sissies.  There kids need to watch this video in order to grow a spine.
4	 'quarries: '	worth buying			7				risultati
	 DCG = 1 					19494 	 This is, quite possibly, the worst movie ever made. The utter absurdity of the premise is only outmatched by the absolute stupidity of the events that follow. In the realm of Hollywood movies about impossible things that miraculously happen with aircraft, this one deserves top awards. I give one star because you can't give zero, or negative stars. Beyond ridiculously abominable.
	 DCG = 1 					19731 	 An Oldie but a goodie. This is one of those LITTLE MOVIE"S"  that the star made. Not his/her most acclaimed, but one that is truly entertaining and indicative of the talent of the performers and directors. Worth the time.
	 DCG = 3 					24565 	 To me this movie is the best in the series, and really nice looking on blu ray.  Not the best blu ray out there but definitely worth it for the price.  If you've never seen this and your a fan of horror you definitely should get this.
	 DCG = 1 					22702 	 Anybody that has a copy that can be burned on DVD I would be interested in buying as well..the full version of course...let me know ...email me at dudaluvs@hotmail.com
	 DCG = 1 					24426 	 I love this movie. It reminds me of my friends. This movie is brilliant, and possibly the funniest movie I have seen in a while. However a great movie exhibits more than one characteristic, this does. It shows that  growing up sux, especially in a small town where you are the minority. The  ending is a bit depressing and makes you really look at life in and see it  is not all fun and games. BUY IT you will see how the punk seen today,  isn't really punk.
	 DCG = 2 					15687 	 My husbands favorite movie. A must buy, very good viewing quality
	 DCG = 2 					16769 	 I like this but didn't buy for myself.  it has several 20 minute long exercises that are very simple and easy to do.  these are the right duration compared to actual physical therapy sessions we've gone to.  so, for the motivated, determined person this can be a tremendous help and a tremendous savings of money or insurance.  and, since these can be done at home, the convenience is pretty great too.

	 DCG = 2 					25605 	 the visuals rock. it is very scary. the music is perfect for it. this is possibly the scariest movie ever made. i jumped many times.  it was better than i expected. i think  everyone should watch it plus michelle rodriguez is freaking hott.
	 DCG = 1 					25775 	 We've had this LP for years and I've never seen the movie til yesterday.  The soundtrack conjours up all sorts of visual images, and seeing the music on film was fabulous.  This is Frank at his best, and the "mouses" played by Kim Novak & Rita Hayworth were sensational.
	 DCG = 2 					20404 	 I watched this movie as "research" for a performance I'm doing. It wasn't the greatest movie of all time, but the music was nice.
	 DCG = 2 					23172 	 Love the music and story.
	 DCG = 1 					27969 	 This is a feel-good story with familiar music.  The story line is shallow, but I wanted something light and entertaining.  It did the trick.
6	 'quarries: '	amazing visual effects			11				risultati
	 DCG = 1 					25598 	 I`m one of the fans of the video game {Resident Evil} the game is really scary but with the movie nothing scary here except for some awful acting and lame special effects in fact the video game is a lot more fun than the film. All we hope for is some cool special effects and fight scenes But even on that level, "Resident Evil" is a disappointment. I do not think being a fan of the game could've possibly improved my enjoyment of this film.

	 DCG = 1 					23142 	 This is the best movie the Air Force has to offer??? A high school kid managing to steal an F-16????
	 DCG = 1 					30468 	 For the intended audience, it is probably 5 stars. As an adult, I see minor flaws resulting from me being more critical, but none of them will make the movie not enjoyable for kids.
	 DCG = 1 					20505 	 Great film! Dolly Parton is so natural and inspiring and Sally fields is an amazing actress. She steals the movie in the funeral scene.

	 DCG = 1 					16895 	 I have tried several internet marketing approaches, but Wendy Stevens' simple step-by-step approach has truly been what the doctor ordered!  Reading through tons of "how to" books have been quite confusing, but having a visual guide to walk you through the process is great!  My business has taken off to a new level thanks to what I've learned from Wendy!  Thanks a million!
	 DCG = 3 					17529 	 Watch it English,then in Japanese with Subtitles.  Well done acting and visuals. There is a lot here. Meaningful to all.

	 DCG = 1 					17120 	 123 Count With Me really helped familiarize my then 2-3 year old daughter with not just the recognition of numbers and the concept of 'how many' but also the concepts of 'sequence' and why we 'count' things. Excellent production with a light sprinkling of humor moms and dads can appreciate while sitting on the couch with the little one. My favorite? The 'Counting Crows'!  Check it out!

	 DCG = 3 					19643 	 This movie was Awsome! The casting for this movie was among the best i'have ever seen. Harrison Ford along with Gary Oldman and Liesel Matthews(who by the way is a beautiful girl) made for a great movie. The action was great and the plane set was extremely detailed. Wolfgang Peterson (the director) made sure to include every detail, he and the rest of the crew did an excellent job. I would recommend this movie to all audiences..Great MOVIE!!!!
	 DCG = 3					19493 	 This is a good movie and will keep you watching all the way through. Harrison Ford is excellent in this and the supporting cast is good as well.  The plot is revelent with all the current world situations. The ending makes you want to cheer!
	 DCG = 2 					26274 	 Fantastic cast songs and plot...

It's something to show my 11 year old niece when she tries to tell me One Direction is the best pop teen band to come from England, this movie will set her straight.
