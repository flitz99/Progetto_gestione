Categoria: Movies and TV, Nome del prodotto : The Prince of Tides VHS 
Autore recensione: Garlon M. Harvey
Testo recensione: This movie is Streisand's best, and ditto for Nick Nolte. It's the story of Tom Wingo. It is the story of passion and love and hate and fear and redemption. Based on Pat Conroy's brilliant novel it is mesmerizing and touches the heart in a way that no other movie has quite managed to do.

Autore recensione: Risa Montgomery
Testo recensione: I enjoyed this movie very much.  After just finishing the novel I bought  this movie.  I was really happy to see how close they stayed to the actual  book.  Most other movies take advantage of it.  This is a must! The camera  work done in the film is also really great.  I especially loved the way  that they ended it.  Ioan is fabulous and Charlotte shines as  Miss. Havisham.  Orlick was amazing!!  In fact everything about this movie  was! A VERY VERY MUST!!!

Categoria: Movies and TV, Nome del prodotto : Close Encounters of the Third Kind VHS 
Autore recensione: Kindle Customer
Testo recensione: this is one of my top five favorite movies of all time.  The visual effects were groundbreaking for their day and still hold up well over 30 years later.  I particularly enjoyed Richard Dreyfus's acting as he accurately conveys the peculiar sense of urgency that motivates his character.
